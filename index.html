    <h2>About our Database</h2>
    <p>Ignis Libri Library lends an average of 30,000 books/movies annually to its 10,000 members. The Ignis Libri Library database aims to eliminate the inefficiencies associated with manual bookkeeping by introducing a centralized and automated solution.

The implementation of a user-friendly website is expected to reduce manual workload by 30%, allowing staff to focus more on personalized member services. Our library anticipates achieving a 95% accuracy rate in book inventory management, ensuring precise tracking of each book copy and contributing to a seamless lending experience.</p>
